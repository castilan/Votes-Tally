# Votes-Tally
A ‘c’ routine that used hardware registers to store the values of votes by the user. 
The votes were entered via an xterm standard input. The register with the total number of votes is then moved into the register that interacts with the integer printing subroutine.
The end of the program relays to the terminal the total change in votes.
